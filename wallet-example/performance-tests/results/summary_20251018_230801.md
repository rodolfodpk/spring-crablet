## Test Coverage

- **Wallet Creation**: Load testing with concurrent users
- **Deposits**: Performance testing of deposit operations
- **Withdrawals**: Performance testing of withdrawal operations
- **Transfers**: Success, insufficient balance, and concurrency conflict scenarios
- **Mixed Workload**: Realistic user behavior simulation
- **History Queries**: Pagination and query performance
- **Spike Testing**: System resilience under load spikes

## Test Data Management

- **Wallet Pool**: 100 pre-seeded wallets (perf-wallet-001 to perf-wallet-100)
- **Initial Balance Range**: 500-10000
- **Partitioning**: VUs operate on different wallet subsets to avoid conflicts
- **Cleanup**: Enabled
