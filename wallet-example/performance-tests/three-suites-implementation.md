# Three Suites Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented three isolated performance test suites with comprehensive automated testing. The implementation
has evolved from the original three-suite approach to a unified automated test runner that covers all scenarios.

**Related Documentation:**

- [README.md](./README.md) - Main performance tests documentation
- [k6-performance-test-results.md](./k6-performance-test-results.md) - Current test results
- [test-data-strategy.md](./test-data-strategy.md) - Data management strategy

## Current Implementation

### Automated Test Runner

The performance tests are now orchestrated by a single automated runner (`run-all-tests.sh`) that provides:

- **Complete Cleanup**: Stops all containers, kills processes, frees ports
- **PostgreSQL Validation**: Waits for container health and validates connections
- **Application Validation**: Waits for Spring Boot to be healthy (status="UP")
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Runs all 9 test scenarios including deposits and withdrawals
- **Error Handling**: Continues on failures and reports results
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ensures cleanup runs even on script failure

### Test Coverage

The current implementation includes comprehensive coverage of all wallet operations:

1. **Wallet Creation Load Test** - Concurrent wallet creation
2. **Deposit Performance Test** - High-frequency deposit operations
3. **Withdrawal Performance Test** - High-frequency withdrawal operations
4. **Transfer Success Test** - Successful money transfers
5. **Mixed Workload Success Test** - Realistic user behavior simulation
6. **History Query Performance Test** - Pagination and query performance
7. **Spike Success Test** - System resilience under load spikes
8. **Transfer Insufficient Balance Test** - Business rule enforcement
9. **Transfer Concurrency Conflict Test** - Event sourcing concurrency control

## Original Three-Suite Design

The original design included three separate test suites:

### 1. Success Suite

- **Goal**: Performance baseline with 0% expected errors
- **Data**: 1000 wallets with 50K-100K balance each
- **Tests**: Transfer, mixed workload, spike testing
- **Status**: ✅ **Integrated into automated runner**

### 2. Insufficient Balance Suite

- **Goal**: Validate business rule enforcement
- **Data**: 10 wallets with 100-500 balance, transfers of 200-500
- **Expected**: High 400 Bad Request rate due to insufficient funds
- **Status**: ✅ **Integrated into automated runner**

### 3. Concurrency Suite

- **Goal**: Validate event sourcing optimistic concurrency control
- **Data**: 3 wallets with 50K-100K balance, 50 VUs hammering them
- **Expected**: High 409 Conflict rate due to concurrency conflicts
- **Status**: ✅ **Integrated into automated runner**

## Files Structure

### Configuration Files

- `config.js` - Main configuration for automated runner
- `config-success.js` - Success suite configuration
- `config-insufficient.js` - Insufficient balance suite configuration
- `config-concurrency.js` - Concurrency suite configuration

### Test Scripts

- `wallet-creation-load.js` - Wallet creation performance
- `deposit-test.js` - Deposit operations performance
- `withdrawal-test.js` - Withdrawal operations performance
- `transfer-success.js` - Successful transfer operations
- `mixed-workload-success.js` - Mixed workload simulation
- `history-query-performance.js` - History query performance
- `spike-success.js` - Spike resilience testing
- `transfer-insufficient-balance.js` - Insufficient balance scenarios
- `transfer-concurrency-conflict.js` - Concurrency conflict scenarios

### Helper Functions

- `setup/helpers.js` - Common helper functions for all tests
- `setup/seed-data.js` - Data seeding for automated runner
- `setup/seed-success-data.js` - Success suite data seeding
- `setup/seed-insufficient-data.js` - Insufficient balance data seeding
- `setup/seed-concurrency-data.js` - Concurrency suite data seeding

### Run Scripts

- `run-all-tests.sh` - **Main automated runner** (recommended)
- `run-success-tests.sh` - Success suite only
- `run-insufficient-test.sh` - Insufficient balance test only
- `run-concurrency-test.sh` - Concurrency conflict test only

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Unified Testing

- Single command runs all tests: `./run-all-tests.sh`
- Consistent data management across all scenarios
- Unified reporting and result storage

### 2. Robust Validation

- Each step is validated before proceeding
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Automatic cleanup on failure

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage

- All wallet operations tested (create, deposit, withdraw, transfer, history)
- Both success and failure scenarios covered
- Performance and resilience testing included

### 4. Easy Maintenance

- Centralized configuration management
- Reusable helper functions
- Clear separation of concerns

## Usage

### Recommended Approach

```bash
# Run all tests with automated setup and cleanup
cd performance-tests
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### Individual Suite Testing

```bash
# Success suite only
./run-success-tests.sh

# Insufficient balance test only
./run-insufficient-test.sh

# Concurrency conflict test only
./run-concurrency-test.sh
```

### Individual Test Execution

```bash
# Run specific tests
k6 run deposit-test.js
k6 run withdrawal-test.js
k6 run transfer-success.js
# ... etc
```

## Results and Reporting

### Automated Reporting

- Test results saved to `results/` directory with timestamps
- Summary report generated automatically
- Individual test results in JSON format
- Performance metrics and thresholds tracked

### Monitoring

- Application health monitoring during tests
- Database performance metrics
- Resilience4j circuit breaker status
- Real-time test execution status

## Migration from Original Design

The current implementation successfully migrates from the original three-suite design:

1. **Preserved Intent**: All original test scenarios are maintained
2. **Enhanced Execution**: Robust automated runner replaces manual orchestration
3. **Expanded Coverage**: Added deposit and withdrawal performance tests
4. **Improved Reliability**: Better error handling and validation
5. **Simplified Usage**: Single command runs all tests

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tests in parallel
2. **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust load based on system performance
3. **Advanced Reporting**: Generate detailed performance analysis
4. **Integration Testing**: Include end-to-end workflow testing
5. **Load Profiling**: Add memory and CPU profiling during tests

### Configuration Options

- Environment-specific configurations
- Customizable test durations and load patterns
- Configurable performance thresholds
- Optional test data cleanup

## Conclusion

The three-suite implementation has evolved into a comprehensive, automated performance testing solution that maintains
the original design principles while providing enhanced reliability, coverage, and ease of use. The automated runner
ensures consistent, repeatable test execution with proper validation and cleanup.
