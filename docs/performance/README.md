# Performance Testing

Performance tests for the wallet application using k6 load testing tool.

**Note**: Performance tests require the application to be running. Use `make start` to start all services, or `make start-test` to start with rate limiting disabled for testing.

**All core operations meet performance targets** with excellent response times and low error rates.

## Running Tests

### Quick Test (Wallet Creation Only)

```bash
make perf-quick
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
make perf-test
```

### Individual Tests

```bash
cd performance-tests
k6 run wallet-creation-load.js
k6 run simple-deposit-test.js
k6 run simple-transfer-test.js
```

## Test Configuration

- **Duration**: 50 seconds per test
- **Concurrent Users**: 5-50 depending on test
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17.x via Docker Compose
- **Connection Pool**: HikariCP (50 max connections)

## Performance Targets

- **Wallet Creation**: < 500ms (95th percentile)
- **Deposits/Withdrawals/Transfers**: < 300ms (95th percentile)
- **History Queries**: < 1000ms (95th percentile)
- **Spike Operations**: < 1000ms (95th percentile)
- **Mixed Workload**: < 800ms (95th percentile)

## Monitoring During Tests

Use Grafana dashboards to monitor performance in real-time:

- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Metrics**: JVM, database connections, HTTP response times
