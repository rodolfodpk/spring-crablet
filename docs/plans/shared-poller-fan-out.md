# Plan: Within-Module Batch Fetch + In-Memory Fan-Out (v9 — approved)

v9 adds six code-backed fixes (handler failure semantics, startup CATCHING_UP detection, per-module cap scope, backoff facade gap, getLag deprecation, legacy removal framing) and four editorial refinements (property naming, NOTIFY skip rule, cap scope for catch-up, pollingInterval side effect). v8 content retained.

## Context

Today, N views = N separate DB queries per wakeup cycle. Same for automations and outbox. Each `EventProcessorImpl` schedules one task per processor ID (`doInitializeSchedulers`); `requestImmediatePoll` iterates every enabled processor on NOTIFY — so N views produce N concurrent read queries per wakeup.

The fix: keep module-level isolation (views, automations, outbox stay separate) but within each module execute **one query per cycle** and route events in-memory to the right processor.

## Module isolation — unchanged

```
crablet-views        → own EventProcessor (own leader lock, own scheduler)
crablet-automations  → own EventProcessor (own leader lock, own scheduler)
crablet-outbox       → own EventProcessor (own leader lock, own scheduler)
```

**Outbox remains its own EventProcessor.** A slow or backlogged views shared loop does not delay outbox — they run on completely independent schedulers and leader locks. If outbox latency needs tuning, the levers are polling intervals, batch sizes, read-replica capacity, or isolating outbox to its own deployment — not the module split itself.

Scheduler mode depends on the feature flag:
- **shared-fetch disabled (default):** one scheduled task per processor — existing behaviour unchanged
- **shared-fetch enabled:** one shared module scheduler; N processors are served by that single task

## Three-cursor model

```
moduleScanCursor             per module     how far the module has fetched from the DB
processor.scannedPosition    per processor  last event position the processor has considered
processor.handledPosition    per processor  last matching event successfully processed
                                            (= current lastPosition, public API unchanged)
```

### Update rules per cycle

`moduleScanCursor` always advances to window end after every fetch. It never stalls.

| Case | `handledPosition` | `scannedPosition` | Next processor state |
|---|---|---|---|
| No matching events in window | unchanged | → window end | — |
| Matches ≤ batchSize, handler OK | → last matched position | → **window end** | — |
| Matches > batchSize, dispatched batch OK | → last dispatched matched position | → last dispatched matched position | → `CATCHING_UP` |
| Handler failed | unchanged | unchanged | → `CATCHING_UP` (or `FAILED` if maxErrors) |
| PAUSED / FAILED / CATCHING_UP (excluded) | unchanged | unchanged | — |

**Why `scannedPosition → window end` on full success:** if the module fetched positions 1–1000 and a processor matched only event 200, after successfully handling 200 the processor has already evaluated 201–1000 and found nothing. Its `scannedPosition` must become 1000 (window end), not 200 — otherwise it looks artificially behind and triggers unnecessary catch-up.

**Why `scannedPosition → last dispatched` on partial dispatch:** if the window contains 600 matching events and `processor.batchSize = 100`, the processor has only safely considered through the 100th matched event. It has not evaluated the rest. Set `scannedPosition` to the last dispatched matched position and mark `CATCHING_UP` to handle the remainder.

## v1 fetch: position-only (no union filter in SQL)

```sql
SELECT type, tags, data, transaction_id, position, occurred_at, correlation_id, causation_id
FROM events
WHERE position > ?
ORDER BY position ASC
LIMIT ?
```

No tag/type filter in SQL. `EventSelectionMatcher` handles all routing in-memory after the fetch.

**Why position-only for v1:**
- `moduleScanCursor` is a true scan cursor over the event log, not a "deliverable active-selection cursor." Those are different things.
- Union-filtered SQL only sees events active processors care about right now. If all processors are PAUSED or events only match a FAILED processor, the union returns zero rows and the module cursor stalls — contradicting the guarantee that it always advances.
- Position-only fetch eliminates the stall risk entirely. The tradeoff is reading irrelevant events; that is acceptable for a correct v1.
- Very predictable query plan: primary key / position index, no GIN scan, no complex OR predicate.

**v2 optimization (deferred):** union-filtered fetch as an optional mode after v1 cursor semantics are proven correct and EXPLAIN validated at scale.

## Isolation and durability rules

### Handler exception isolation

Handler exceptions are isolated per processor. A failed processor does not abort dispatch for other processors in the same module cycle. The module cycle catches each processor's exception independently, marks that processor appropriately, then continues with the remaining processors and still advances `moduleScanCursor` to window end.

Letting one handler exception propagate out and abort the whole module run would recreate head-of-line blocking — exactly the problem the design is solving.

**On handler exception: `handledPosition` and `scannedPosition` are both left unchanged.** `EventHandler.handle()` throws on failure with no partial-progress signal (it returns `int` for matched count, not a partial-success cursor). The shared loop cannot determine the last safely handled event within a batch. Partial intra-batch advance is not supported in v1; if needed later, it requires a richer handler contract.

### Cursor update durability order

For a processor with matched events, the persistence order is:

1. Run handler.
2. Update `handledPosition` only after handler success.
3. Update `scannedPosition` only after the `handledPosition`/scanned decision is determined.
4. Advance `moduleScanCursor` after the full window has been considered by all processors.

If `moduleScanCursor` advances but a processor cursor update fails, recovery is safe — the processor catches up from its older `scannedPosition`. If `handledPosition` update fails after a successful handler, existing at-least-once semantics already permit reprocessing.

## New flow (per module, shared-fetch enabled)

When shared-fetch is **disabled**, the existing per-processor `EventProcessorImpl` loop applies — this section describes only the opt-in path.

```
Wakeup → 1 scheduled task fires per module
  1. Load moduleScanCursor
  2. Fetch: SELECT WHERE position > moduleScanCursor ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT fetchBatchSize
  3. If zero rows fetched: record module-level empty (backoff eligible), return
  4. For each fetched event: match in-memory against each ACTIVE, non-catching-up processor
     using EventSelectionMatcher
  5. For each processor:
       a. Matches ≤ batchSize AND handler OK:
            update handledPosition to last matched position
            update scannedPosition to window end
       b. Matches > batchSize AND dispatched batch OK:
            update handledPosition to last dispatched matched position
            update scannedPosition to last dispatched matched position
            mark processor as CATCHING_UP for remainder
       c. Handler failed:
            record error; do not advance handledPosition or scannedPosition
            mark processor as CATCHING_UP (or FAILED if maxErrors)
       d. No matching events:
            advance scannedPosition to window end (last fetched position)
  6. Advance moduleScanCursor to last fetched event position
```

**"Empty" for backoff = zero rows fetched from DB.** Fetching rows that no active processor matched still counts as useful work (scan cursor advanced) and does not trigger backoff.

## Processor internal states

Public `ProcessorStatus` (ACTIVE, PAUSED, FAILED) is unchanged.

Internally add `CATCHING_UP` — not exposed publicly, tracked in a module-level set:

```
ACTIVE           → participates in shared fan-out
PAUSED           → excluded from shared fan-out; scannedPosition frozen until resume
FAILED           → excluded from shared fan-out; scannedPosition frozen until resume
CATCHING_UP      → excluded from shared fan-out; runs own bounded catch-up loop
```

A processor transitions to `CATCHING_UP` when its `scannedPosition < moduleScanCursor` (on resume or after a handler failure that doesn't yet hit `maxErrors`).

**Startup detection:** when the shared module scheduler initializes, before the first shared cycle runs, check every ACTIVE processor's persisted `scannedPosition` against the persisted `moduleScanCursor`. Any processor where `scannedPosition < moduleScanCursor` is immediately placed in `CATCHING_UP`. Without this check, a restarted application would let an ACTIVE processor with a stale `scannedPosition` participate in shared fan-out and silently skip historical matching events between its position and the module cursor.

## Module scheduler semantics

**Polling interval:** `min(pollingIntervalMs across all enabled processor configs)` — preserves the fastest processor's latency expectation. Since shared mode is opt-in, this is acceptable. Side effect: adding a processor with a faster interval to an existing module silently speeds up the poll rate for all other processors in that module — it increases DB read frequency for the whole module, which has a read-cost impact operators should be aware of.

**Backoff:** module-level only. Empty = zero DB rows fetched. Fetched rows with zero dispatches = not empty (do not increment backoff, do not reset it either).

**NOTIFY wakeup:** with shared-fetch enabled, one wakeup schedules **one** immediate module run (not N processor runs). With shared-fetch disabled, behaviour is unchanged: `requestImmediatePoll` still schedules each enabled processor at delay 0.

**Concurrency guard:** one shared cycle or catch-up orchestration at a time per module. Use a module-level run slot (similar to today's `runningProcessors` map) so catch-up and shared dispatch cannot run concurrently for the same module. When a NOTIFY wakeup fires while a module run is already in progress, **skip** the wakeup — the running cycle will advance `moduleScanCursor` anyway. Do not queue pending runs; a single missed wakeup is recovered by the next scheduled poll.

## Resume and catch-up path

On `resume(processorId)`:
1. Set public status to ACTIVE.
2. If `scannedPosition < moduleScanCursor`: mark processor as `CATCHING_UP`.
3. Run bounded catch-up loop using a new **internal** method:
   ```
   fetchEventsUntil(processorId, afterPosition=scannedPosition,
                    upToPosition=moduleScanCursor, batchSize=processor.batchSize)
   ```
   SQL: `WHERE position > afterPosition AND position <= upToPosition AND <processor selection> ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT batchSize`
4. Per iteration:
   - **Rows found:** handle batch; advance `handledPosition` and `scannedPosition` to last handled row; repeat.
   - **Zero rows found (sparse — no matching events before `moduleScanCursor`):** advance `scannedPosition` directly to `moduleScanCursor`; exit catch-up. This mirrors the "no matching events in window" rule from the shared loop — sparse processors must not stay in `CATCHING_UP` forever.
5. Once `scannedPosition >= moduleScanCursor`: remove from `CATCHING_UP` set, processor rejoins shared fan-out.

**Why bounded and not `eventFetcher.fetchEvents` as-is:** the existing `fetchEvents` has no upper bound. If `moduleScanCursor = 1000`, `scannedPosition = 500`, and the next matching event is at position 1500, unbounded catch-up would process position 1500 before the shared module cursor reaches it — breaking the model. The bounded method stays internal and does not change the public `EventFetcher` interface.

Catch-up loop is guarded by the module-level run slot. Does not disturb `moduleScanCursor`.

**Future simplification (post-v1):** if `catching_up_count` metrics show CATCHING_UP is frequent in practice, consider folding the catch-up loop into the main module cycle as a "priority lane" rather than running it separately. Do not do this in v1 — the separate bounded loop exists to prove ordering and bounds correctness first.

## In-memory event matching: `EventSelectionMatcher`

New class in `crablet-event-poller`:

```java
EventSelectionMatcher.matches(EventSelection selection, StoredEvent event) → boolean
```

Mirrors `EventSelectionSqlBuilder` exactly:
- empty event types = match all; otherwise type must be in set
- required tag keys: all must be present as `key=*` in tags array
- any-of tag keys: at least one must be present
- exact tag key=value pairs: must match exactly

Unit-tested for parity with SQL builder across all filter combinations. Tag key/value inputs are domain-controlled (same trust boundary as `EventSelectionSqlBuilder`).

**Extensibility:** The pipeline is **fetch → match → dispatch to `EventHandler`** — it is not tied to JDBC view writers. Any module that today uses `EventHandler` (including **webhook-style** or HTTP-heavy automations) can reuse the same fan-out layer later without changing the fetch SQL; only the handler implementation differs.

## Schema

New tables. **Not** owned by the poller jar (no Flyway in `crablet-event-poller` main scope today).

**Required only when shared-fetch is enabled.** Flyway always runs migrations that are present — it does not conditionally skip them. What the feature flag controls is **runtime access**: when `crablet.views.shared-fetch.enabled=false` (the default), the shared-fetch code paths must not query the new tables at all. Existing apps that have not added the new migrations will not have the tables, but that is safe because the runtime code never touches them when disabled. Apps must not fail startup just because the new classpath code exists.

**Migration added to:**
- `wallet-example-app` (Flyway migration)
- `crablet-test-support` (shared test migration)

**Documented in:** `crablet-event-poller/README.md` and a new `crablet-event-poller/SCHEMA.md` listing required tables for shared-fetch mode.

```sql
CREATE TABLE crablet_module_scan_progress (
    module_name   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    scan_position BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE crablet_processor_scan_progress (
    module_name       TEXT   NOT NULL,
    processor_id      TEXT   NOT NULL,
    scanned_position  BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (module_name, processor_id)
);
```

**Outbox `processor_id` serialization:** use `topic + ":" + publisherName` as the stable string key (e.g. `"orders:kafka"`). This is already the implicit `toString()` convention on `TopicPublisherPair`. Formalize it as a `toKey()` method on `TopicPublisherPair` to prevent drift if `toString()` changes.

`handledPosition` stays in each module's existing progress table — no change to existing schema.

## Batch size

```properties
crablet.views.fetch-batch-size=1000
crablet.automations.fetch-batch-size=1000
crablet.outbox.fetch-batch-size=1000

# Optional global guardrail — caps events fetched per individual module cycle (applied
# independently to each module's scheduler). This is a global default/maximum, not a
# true cross-module total — views, automations, and outbox schedulers are independent
# and have no shared coordinator. A real cross-module cap is out of scope for v1.
crablet.shared-fetch.max-events-per-cycle=5000   # default: unset (no global cap)
```

Default: 1000. Per-processor `batchSize` still caps matched-event dispatch per processor per call. The optional global cap protects the JVM from large shared-fetch windows without requiring per-module tuning. The global cap applies to the **shared module fetch only** (`LIMIT` on the position-only query) — it does **not** apply to `fetchEventsUntil` in the bounded catch-up loop. Catch-up uses `processor.batchSize` per iteration and is already bounded by `upToPosition=moduleScanCursor`; applying the global cap there would risk a processor that never fully closes its lag if the cap is smaller than the gap.

## Feature flag

```properties
crablet.views.shared-fetch.enabled=true   # default: false
```

**Property naming:** Keep `crablet.views.shared-fetch.enabled` (and equivalents for automations/outbox) for v1 — consistent with the existing `crablet.views.*` namespace and already used throughout this doc. Rename in a future property-stabilization pass once the feature is proven in production; do not rename during initial rollout.

Old per-processor scheduler behavior is fully preserved when disabled. Backoff granularity change (per-processor → per-module) only affects apps that opt in.

**Enabling the flag requires the scan progress migrations to be applied first.** Enabling it before the migrations exist will cause startup or first-poll failure when the code attempts to read `crablet_module_scan_progress` / `crablet_processor_scan_progress`. Apply the Flyway migrations, verify, then set the flag.

**When disabled, no shared-fetch beans are constructed or validated.** The disabled path must behave exactly like today's `EventProcessorImpl` — no eager initialization of scan-progress repositories, no table access, no new scheduled tasks. Spring `@ConditionalOnProperty` on all shared-fetch-specific beans is the safe wiring approach.

### Implementation structure (dual path, single facade)

Do **not** scatter `if (sharedFetch)` through call sites. Prefer:

- One **`EventProcessor`** (or module runner) **facade** wired by Spring.
- Two **strategies**: **legacy** = current `EventProcessorImpl` per-processor scheduling; **shared** = module scan + fan-out + new progress tables.
- **`@ConditionalOnProperty`** (or equivalent) selects **one** strategy at startup — no giant inline branching.

Ship with **both** strategies behind the flag for safe rollout. Removing the legacy strategy is a future **major or minor version cleanup decision** — it depends on downstream consumers and OSS compatibility guarantees. Do not assume removal as part of this implementation; track it separately when stabilizing the public API.

**Backoff reporting:** `ProcessorManagementServiceImpl` currently uses `instanceof EventProcessorImpl` to read `BackoffState` (in `getBackoffInfo` / `getAllBackoffInfo`). The shared strategy must expose backoff state through a small internal capability interface (e.g., `BackoffInfoProvider`) that both legacy `EventProcessorImpl` and the new shared implementation implement. The management service should target the interface, not the concrete class — otherwise the shared path silently returns no backoff info.

## Management metrics (correct definitions)

- `scanLag = moduleScanCursor - scannedPosition` — real catch-up lag; 0 for healthy sparse processors
- `lastHandledPosition = handledPosition` — last matching event successfully processed
- **Do not expose `moduleScanCursor - handledPosition`** — misleading for sparse processors

**Existing `getLag()` in shared mode:** `ProcessorManagementServiceImpl.getLag()` currently queries `MAX(events.position) - handledPosition`. In shared mode this is misleading for sparse processors — it reports large lag even when `scanLag = 0` and the processor is healthy. In shared mode, `getLag()` must be replaced by or clearly superseded by `scanLag` in the management response. Do not expose both without distinguishing them; the old formula is the exact metric the plan calls out as wrong.

New management status fields (additive, backward compatible):
- `scannedPosition`
- `scanLag`
- `catchingUp` (boolean)

### Operational visibility metrics (new per module cycle)

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `events.module.fetched` | Events fetched from DB per cycle — baseline for read cost |
| `events.module.matched` | Events matched to at least one processor — signal/noise ratio |
| `events.module.dispatched` | Total events dispatched across all processors — actual work done |
| `events.processor.catching_up_count` | Processors currently in CATCHING_UP state |

Position-only v1 can read many irrelevant events in high-volume streams. The `fetched / matched / dispatched` ratio makes the cost visible and determines whether v2 union-filter optimization is needed in practice. Make `fetch-batch-size` easy to tune independently so operators can adjust read cost without touching individual processor configs.

## Rollout order

1. **`EventSelectionMatcher`** — standalone unit tests, no Spring wiring
2. **Cursor state machine** as internal classes, unit-tested independently from scheduling
3. **Schema** — migrations in `wallet-example-app` + `crablet-test-support`; document in poller README
4. **Shared fetch loop for views only** behind `crablet.views.shared-fetch.enabled=true`
5. **Integration tests** (priority-ordered — first three are highest bug-risk):
   - **Handler failure mid-batch:** processor A throws on a matched batch; verify `handledPosition` and `scannedPosition` are **not advanced at all** (no partial-progress signal from `EventHandler`), A enters `CATCHING_UP` or `FAILED`, processor B in the same cycle succeeds, `moduleScanCursor` still advances to window end.
   - **App restart with stale scannedPosition:** restart with `moduleScanCursor` ahead of a processor's persisted `scannedPosition`; verify the processor enters `CATCHING_UP` before the first shared cycle runs and correctly processes all missed matching events.
   - **Resume after long pause with sparse events:** pause a processor, let `moduleScanCursor` advance far ahead with events the processor does not match, resume; verify `scannedPosition` jumps to `moduleScanCursor` (sparse zero-row path), `catchingUp=false`, no retry loop, no phantom lag.
   - **High volume with ~80% irrelevant events:** populate the event log so most rows do not match any active processor; verify `fetched` is high, `matched` is low, `dispatched` is correct, and the cycle completes without JVM memory pressure or timeout.
   - position-only fetch: module cursor always advances
   - sparse filter (zero matches): `scanLag = 0`, no fake lag
   - PAUSED processor: module cursor advances, processor stays put
   - FAILED processor: same
   - Resume after pause: catch-up from `scannedPosition`
   - Handler failure → CATCHING_UP → resume
   - Disjoint filters (no overlap between processors)
   - Per-processor `batchSize` respected during dispatch
6. Port automations
7. Port outbox

## Known risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Complexity creep** — new cursors, tables, matcher, internal `CATCHING_UP` | Feature flag + facade; delete legacy path once stable; keep poller core readable |
| **Catch-up / sparse bugs** — highest implementation risk | Priority integration tests (handler mid-batch, long pause + sparse, bounded catch-up invariants) |
| **Position-only read cost** — high volume + many irrelevant rows | `fetched`/`matched`/`dispatched` metrics; optional global cap; v2 union-filter when proven necessary |
| **v2 sooner than expected** | Treat union-filter as productized follow-on, not theoretical |

## What NOT to change

- Public `EventProcessor`, `EventHandler`, `EventFetcher`, `EventSelection`, `ProcessorStatus` (ACTIVE/PAUSED/FAILED) interfaces
- Existing `lastPosition` semantics in public management API
- Existing module progress tables (`view_progress`, `automation_progress`, `outbox_topic_progress`)
- Leader election
- LISTEN/NOTIFY wakeup
- Per-module configuration properties (add, don't replace)

## Revision notes

- **v5:** Position-only fetch, three-cursor model, internal `CATCHING_UP`, bounded catch-up, schema in app + test-support, operational metrics, handler isolation rules, migration-before-enable and conditional beans, handler-isolation integration test in rollout.
- **v6:** Version bump; "New flow" explicitly scoped to shared-fetch with pointer to legacy path when disabled; NOTIFY behaviour spelled out for shared-fetch on vs off; this revision log.
- **v7:** Explicit outbox isolation clarification (outbox is always its own EventProcessor — slow views loop cannot delay outbox); optional global `max-events-per-cycle` guardrail; integration tests expanded with priority-ordered top three (handler mid-batch failure, long pause + sparse events, 80% irrelevant volume); post-v1 CATCHING_UP simplification note added to catch-up section.
- **v8:** Implementation structure (facade + dual strategies + remove legacy later); property naming alternatives; extensibility note (any `EventHandler`, webhooks); "Known risks and mitigations" table; dedupe duplicate handler-isolation test bullet (covered by first priority test).
- **v9:** Six code-backed fixes: handler failure leaves `handledPosition`/`scannedPosition` fully unchanged (no partial-progress signal from current `EventHandler` contract); startup CATCHING_UP detection for processors where `scannedPosition < moduleScanCursor` on init; `max-events-per-cycle` is per-module not cross-module; facade needs `BackoffInfoProvider` interface so management backoff reporting survives the strategy switch; existing `getLag()` must be replaced/superseded by `scanLag` in shared mode; legacy strategy removal framed as future OSS major/minor version decision. Four editorial fixes: property naming resolved (keep `shared-fetch` for v1); NOTIFY + concurrency guard = skip-if-busy; global cap scope = shared fetch only, not catch-up; `min(pollingIntervalMs)` side effect documented.
