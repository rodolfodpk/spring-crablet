# Wallet API Performance Tests

k6 performance tests for the Wallet API. All tests run for 50 seconds.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run ALL performance tests (comprehensive suite)
make perf-test

# Run only wallet creation test (quick validation)
make perf-quick

# Monitor tests live with Grafana dashboards
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana loki promtail
# Then open: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

# Or run individual tests manually
make start-test
cd performance-tests
k6 run setup/seed-success-data.js
k6 run wallet-creation-load.js
k6 run simple-deposit-test.js
# ... run other tests as needed
cd ..
make stop
```

## Test Scenarios

| Test File | VUs | Operations | Throughput (rps) | p95 (ms) | Error Rate | Status |
|-----------|-----|------------|------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| `wallet-creation-load.js` | 20 | 34,261 | 685 | 44.9 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-deposit-test.js` | 10 | 19,106 | 382 | 42.2 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-withdrawal-test.js` | 10 | 19,812 | 396 | 37.4 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-transfer-test.js` | 10 | 14,612 | 292 | 49.0 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-history-test.js` | 15 | 30,113 | 602 | 34.2 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-spike-test.js` | 5‚Üí50‚Üí5 | 14,850 | 297 | 171.0 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-mixed-workload-test.js` | 25 | 20,199 | 404 | 136.8 | 0% | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-insufficient-balance-test.js` | 10 | 39,054 | 781 | 29.3 | 99.7%* | ‚úÖ |
| `simple-concurrency-test.js` | 50 | 10,096 | 202 | 417.4 | 0% | ‚úÖ |

*Note: 99.7% error rate for insufficient balance test is expected as it tests error conditions.

## Performance Results

**Current performance (command persistence DISABLED in test profile):**

- **Wallet Creation**: 685 rps, 44.9ms p95 latency
- **Deposit**: 382 rps, 42.2ms p95 latency  
- **Withdrawal**: 396 rps, 37.4ms p95 latency
- **Transfer**: 292 rps, 49.0ms p95 latency
- **History**: 602 rps, 34.2ms p95 latency
- **Spike Test**: 297 rps, 171.0ms p95 latency
- **Mixed Workload**: 404 rps, 136.8ms p95 latency
- **Concurrency**: 202 rps, 417.4ms p95 latency

### Command Storage Configuration

Performance tests run with the **TEST profile** which has `crablet.eventstore.persist-commands=false` for maximum throughput.

**In production:**
- Command persistence is **ENABLED** by default (`application.properties`)
- This provides full audit trail of all commands
- Some performance overhead is expected (storing additional command metadata)
- Can be disabled via `crablet.eventstore.persist-commands=false` if audit trail is not needed

**In tests:**
- Most tests run with command persistence **DISABLED** (`application-test.properties`)
- Tests that verify command storage explicitly enable it via `@TestPropertySource(properties = "crablet.eventstore.persist-commands=true")`

## Running Tests

### Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)

```bash
# Start application with TEST profile (rate limiting disabled)
make start-test

# Seed test data (1000 wallets)
cd performance-tests
k6 run setup/seed-success-data.js

# Run individual tests
k6 run simple-deposit-test.js
k6 run simple-transfer-test.js
k6 run simple-concurrency-test.js

# Stop application
cd ..
make stop
```

### Option 2: Using Maven Directly

```bash
# Start API with test profile on localhost:8080
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=test

# Run individual tests
k6 run wallet-creation-load.js
k6 run simple-deposit-test.js
k6 run simple-withdrawal-test.js
k6 run simple-transfer-test.js
k6 run simple-history-test.js
k6 run simple-spike-test.js
k6 run simple-mixed-workload-test.js
k6 run simple-concurrency-test.js
```

### Option 3: Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests with automatic setup and cleanup
make perf-test
```

### Available Make Targets

| Command | Description | Tests Run |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `make perf-test` | **Complete suite** - All 9 performance tests | Wallet creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, history, spike, mixed workload, insufficient balance, concurrency |
| `make perf-quick` | **Quick validation** - Wallet creation only | Wallet creation load test only |
| `make perf-run-all` | Run all tests (assumes environment is already set up) | All 9 tests |
| `make perf-setup` | Setup test environment only | None |
| `make perf-seed` | Seed test data only | None |
| `make perf-cleanup` | Cleanup test environment only | None |

### Option 4: Run All Tests Manually

```bash
# Start application with TEST profile
make start-test

# Seed test data (1000 wallets)
cd performance-tests
k6 run setup/seed-success-data.js

# Run ALL performance tests in sequence
k6 run wallet-creation-load.js
k6 run simple-deposit-test.js
k6 run simple-withdrawal-test.js
k6 run simple-transfer-test.js
k6 run simple-history-test.js
k6 run simple-spike-test.js
k6 run simple-mixed-workload-test.js
k6 run simple-insufficient-balance-test.js

# Stop application
cd ..
make stop
```

## Live Monitoring with Grafana

üéØ **Monitor performance tests in real-time with Grafana dashboards!**

When running performance tests, you can watch live metrics and system performance:

### Start Monitoring Stack

```bash
# Start observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki)
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana loki promtail

# Access Grafana dashboards
# URL: http://localhost:3000
# Login: admin/admin
```

### Key Dashboards for Performance Testing

| Dashboard | URL | What to Watch During Tests |
|-----------|-----|----------------------------|
| **Application** | `/d/application` | HTTP request rates, latency percentiles, error rates |
| **Business** | `/d/business` | Wallet operations per second, transaction volumes |
| **Database** | `/d/database` | Connection pool usage, query performance |
| **JVM & System** | `/d/jvm-system` | Memory usage, GC pauses, CPU utilization |

### Performance Test Monitoring Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start monitoring stack
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana loki promtail

# 2. Start application with test profile
make start-test

# 3. Open Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
# 4. Navigate to Business dashboard to watch wallet operations
# 5. Run performance tests
make perf-test

# 6. Watch real-time metrics during test execution!
```

**Pro Tip**: Keep the Business dashboard open during tests to see live wallet operation rates and transaction volumes! üìä

## Important: Test Profile

‚ö†Ô∏è **Always use the TEST profile when running performance tests!**

The test profile disables rate limiting to allow accurate performance measurement without artificial throttling. The application automatically uses the test profile when you run:

- `make start-test` - Start with test profile
- `make perf-setup` - Setup performance test environment
- `make perf-test` - Run complete test suite

For more details, see [Test Profile Documentation](../docs/testing/TEST_PROFILE.md).

## Setup

```bash
# Seed test data (1000 wallets)
k6 run setup/seed-success-data.js
```
